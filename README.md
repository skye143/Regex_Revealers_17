# [Description Intoduction](#table-of-contents)
Welcome to the tutorial on regular expressions! In this tutorial, we will explore the intricacies of a specific regular expression and understand its search pattern. Regular expressions (regex) are powerful tools used to match and manipulate text based on specific patterns. By learning how to effectively use regex, you will gain a valuable skill for web development and beyond.

## [Summary](#table-of-contents)
The regex we will be exploring in this tutorial is /^\d{2}-\d{2}-\d{4}$/. This regex pattern matches a date format in the format "dd-mm-yyyy," where "dd" represents the day, "mm" represents the month, and "yyyy" represents the year. Throughout this tutorial, we will break down the various components of this regex and explain their significance.

## [Anchors](#table-of-contents)
Anchors are special characters used to assert the position of a match in the input text. In our regex, we have used the caret (^) anchor at the beginning and the dollar ($) anchor at the end. The caret asserts that the match should start at the beginning of the line, and the dollar asserts that the match should end at the end of the line.

## [Quantifiers](#table-of-contents)
Quantifiers specify the number of occurrences a character or group should have to be considered a match. In our regex, we have used the {2} quantifier after each \d (digit) character class. This means that each digit should occur exactly two times.

## [OR Operator](#table-of-contents)
The OR operator (|) allows us to match either one pattern or another. However, in our specific regex, we do not use the OR operator.

## [Character Classes](#table-of-contents)
Character classes are enclosed in square brackets ([ ]). They define a set of characters that can be matched. In our regex, the \d character class represents any digit from 0 to 9.

## [Flags](#table-of-contents)
Flags are used to modify the behavior of the regex matching. However, in our specific regex, we do not use any flags.

## [Grouping and Capturing](#table-of-contents)
Grouping and capturing allow us to treat multiple characters as a single unit and capture the matched value. In our regex, we do not have any explicit grouping or capturing.

## [cBracket Expressions](#table-of-contents)
Bracket expressions are used to specify a range or a set of characters to match. In our regex, we do not use bracket expressions.

## [Greedy and Lazy Match](#table-of-contents)
The concept of greediness in regex determines whether the matching should be done in the most extensive way possible or in the laziest way possible. In our regex, the matching is greedy by default.

## [Boundaries](#table-of-contents)
Boundaries are used to match positions that are not preceded or followed by specific characters. In our regex, we do not use boundaries.

## [Back-references](#table-of-contents)
Back-references allow us to match the same text that was previously matched by a capturing group. In our regex, we do not have any capturing groups or back-references.

## [Look-ahead and Look-behind](#table-of-contents)
Look-ahead and look-behind assertions are used to match a pattern only if it is followed or preceded by another pattern, without including the matched text in the final result. In our regex, we do not use look-ahead or look-behind assertions.
